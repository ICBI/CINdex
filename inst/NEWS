* Overview
Quantatively calculate chromosome instability index based on DNA copy number profiles.

The CINdex package calculates the chromosome instability (CIN) index that allows to quantitatively characterize genome-wide DNA copy number alterations as a measure of chromosomal instability. It calculates not only overall genomic instability, but also instability in terms of copy number gains and losses separately at the chromosome and cytoband level.

The algorithm and applications for this method is described in a paper (in preparation).
