Description: The CINdex package addresses important area of high-throughput
    genomic analysis. It allows the automated processing and analysis of the
    experimental DNA copy number data generated by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays or
    similar high throughput technologies. It calculates the chromosome instability
    (CIN) index that allows to quantitatively characterize genome-wide DNA copy
    number alterations as a measure of chromosomal instability. This package
    calculates not only overall genomic instability, but also instability in terms
    of copy number gains and losses separately at the chromosome and cytoband level.
