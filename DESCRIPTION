Description: The CINdex package addresses important area of
        high-throughput genomic analysis. It allows the automated
        processing and analysis of the experimental DNA copy number
        data generated by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays or similar high
        throughput technologies. It calculates the chromosome
        instability (CIN) index that allows to quantitatively
        characterize genome-wide DNA copy number alterations as a
        measure of chromosomal instability. This package calculates not
        only overall genomic instability, but also instability in terms
        of copy number gains and losses separately at the chromosome
        and cytoband level.
